This little directory contains everything you need to make the animations
found in this blog post:
http://www.thephysicsmill.com/2015/01/18/whats-in-a-particle/

To run, just clone the directory and call python2 on
make_a_particle.py

Alternatively, you can interact with the code dynamically using an
IPython notebook. See:
